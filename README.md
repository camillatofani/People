### Project description
<a name="description"></a>

I created a fake carousel of people who work on the 90days.it project.


### Technical information
<a name="technical"></a>

In this project I experimented with inserting data from an array to my web page.

Specifically, I have developed a solution that is based on increasing and decreasing the id of the list, and a random solution.
